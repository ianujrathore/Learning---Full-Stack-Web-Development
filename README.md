What is Web development?
* Web development is the craft of building and maintaining functional, digital experiences for the internet. It is an intersection of creative design and logical engineering, focused on turning abstract ideas into reliable, interactive software that anyone can access through a browser.

The Core Pillars of Web Development : 
* Frontend: The interactive visual layer where design meets code to create seamless, user-facing experiences.
* Backend: The hidden architectural core that manages data processing, security, and the business logic of an application.
* Database: The organized digital warehouse responsible for securely storing, retrieving, and protecting vital information.
