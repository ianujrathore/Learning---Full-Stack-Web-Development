What is Web development?
* Web development is the craft of building and maintaining functional, digital experiences for the internet. It is an intersection of creative design and logical engineering, focused on turning abstract ideas into reliable, interactive software that anyone can access through a browser.

The Core Pillars of Web Development : 
* Frontend: The interactive visual layer where design meets code to create seamless, user-facing experiences.
* Backend: The hidden architectural core that manages data processing, security, and the business logic of an application.
* Database: The organized digital warehouse responsible for securely storing, retrieving, and protecting vital information.

What are HTML tags?
An HTML tag is a keyword enclosed in angle brackets: < >. Most tags have:
* Opening tag → `<tagname>`
* Closing tag → `</tagname>` (some tags are self-closing)
* Content → what goes between opening and closing tags 

HTML Documents 
* All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
* The HTML document itself begins with `<html>` and ends with `</html>`.
* The visible part of the HTML document is between `<body>` and `</body>`.
